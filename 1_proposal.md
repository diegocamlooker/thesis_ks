# Proposal

## Introduction
Crowdfunding is one of the most popular ways these days to have a personal project coming to life. Nobody doubts about the benefits that having the cash up front and knowing you audience has in somebody’s economy. But the competition has increased significantly and now you need to go the extra-mile in order to be successful.

I am an enthusiast of tabletop games and, at this point of time, KS is one (if not the largest) boardgame supplier. A game that an editor historically would never agree to publish (too big, too experimental, etc) could now become a reality with the help from the backers. I want to use this project to figure out what makes a project successful (I have an early version of a game created by myself waiting to be polished and promoted), and from there, if successful projects are also good games. We are going to use the data from BGG (BoardGameGeek) to see how they rank among the players and to try to identify the industry shift towards KS. Also, want to query my actual collection, to check my shelves and getting to know my likes better.

## What kinds of questions do I want to answer?

In general, I want this project to be reflective of the crowdfunding backer experience from top to bottom, from the early days of a project until it gets in the backers hands. I want to  focus on the table top gaming category, the biggest in this platform and my favourite. Some of the questions I’d like to address are:

- Which is the percentage of successful projects in the platform?
- What makes a project successful?
- Is actually board games the biggest there?
- How many campaign days are enough to meet the objectives?
- Is there a positive correlation between high ranked games and KS, just due to hype?
- Directly to retail vs coming from KS amount of games graph.
- My KS experience so far.

## How can answering these questions be helpful to a board game data analysts?
Create a better campaign, be able to meet objectives.
